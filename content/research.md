With one foot in French and the other in Francophone studies, Liana’s scholarship examines the works of contemporary migrant (translingual) writers in France from historically non-francophone regions.  Her research lies at the intersection of migrant and transnational studies as well as multilingualism and self-writing.


While many studies in translingualism focus on the interaction between several languages in the text or the authors’ direct accounts of engaging with a new language, Liana’s current book project, *In-Betweenness: Aesthetics and Identity in Contemporary Translingual Francophone Literature*, examines the aesthetic, non-linguistic implications of translingualism in ways that extend beyond these traditional terms of bilingualism. Her project also examines the socioliterary reception of translingual authors in France and their place in a larger debate on world literature in France. Through three case studies – Vassilis Alexakis (Greece), Brina Svit (Slovenia), and Andreï Makine (Russia) – she examines the emergence of new aesthetic forms which, while rooted in the tension between native and adopted tongues, also subvert this language binary and its exploitation by marketing forces. Her analysis calls for a necessary refinement of current approaches to translingualism in order to account for forms of in-betweenness that have been overlooked in the shadow of the bilingual lens.
