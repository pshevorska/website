at 
<a href="https://wesleyan.edu" target="_black">Wesleyan University</a>.
She earned her Ph.D. in French from 
<a href="https://www.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>, 
following an M.A. in French Studies (2011) and a B.A. in Education (French & Russian, 2009) from the 
<a href="https://www.arizona.edu" target="_blank">University of Arizona</a>.
She broadly specializes in 20th-21st-century French and Francophone studies, 
with a focus on migration, transnational studies, multilingualism, identity, 
and the works of contemporary migrant authors from historically non-francophone countries. 
Her forthcoming book chapter 
“L’espace dédalesque de Vassilis Alexakis : errance, (im)mobilité et fabulation dans *L’Enfant grec*” 
is scheduled for publication in *Vassilis Alexakis : chemins croisés* with the Presses Universitaires de Rennes.



Prior to joining Wesleyan, she was an Assistant Professor of French in the 
<a href="https://westpoint.edu/academics/academic-departments/foreign-languages" target="_blank">Department of Foreign Languages</a>
at the 
<a href="https://westpoint.edu" target="_black">United States Military Academy at West Point</a>. 
She has also taught French language and culture at Princeton University 
and the University of Arizona. From 2015 to 2018, she taught French/Francophone literature, grammar, 
and creative writing in Bryn Mawr College’s summer study abroad program (Institut d’Avignon).


Over the last two years, Liana was course director for the two-semester 
Elementary French I & II sequence at West Point. In this role, she implemented a new textbook, 
developed new pedagogical materials (exams, syllabi, projects), and provided training and mentorship 
to junior instructors who teach 130 cadets across 8 sections. In addition to basic language courses, 
she has designed and taught courses in French culture and French/Francophone literatures, such as 
“French Civilization from the Middle Ages to the Belle Époque,” “French Literature from Romanticism to Twitterature,” 
“Modern Odysseys: Between Two Languages and Cultures,” and “Alterity: The Marvelous, the Fantastic, the Surrealist.” 
In Spring 2022, Liana designed and taught a course entitled “French Society through Song” at West Point.
Dr. Pshevorska also served as an academic counselor and worked with Cadets as adviser of the French Forum.
