Liana is a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://fit.princeton.edu" target="_blank">French Literature</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>. Prior to joining Princeton, she earned an M.A. in French Literature and a B.A. in Education from the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu" target="_blank">University of Arizona</a>. She is completing a dissertation on transnational identity and the aesthetics of writing in non-native French in the works of contemporary migrant authors of non-francophone origin. Her research interests lie at the intersection of migration, hospitality, theories of identity, self-writing, as well as transnational and transcultural studies. 

She has taught all levels of French language at Princeton University and at the University of Arizona. Liana has also independently designed and implemented advanced language and literature courses on the literary fantastic and on migration as a faculty member at Bryn Mawrâ€™s study abroad program in Avignon.
