While many studies in translingualism focus on the interaction between several languages in the text or the authors’ direct accounts of engaging with a new language, my dissertation, *In-Betweenness: Aesthetics and Identity in Contemporary Translingual Francophone Literature*, examines the aesthetic implications of translingualism in ways that extend beyond these conventional terms of bilingualism. My project also examines the socioliterary reception of translingual authors in France and their place in a larger debate on world literature in France. Through three case studies – Vassilis Alexakis from Greece, Brina Svit from Slovenia, and Andreï Makine from Russia – I examine the emergence of new aesthetic forms which, while rooted in the tension between native and adopted tongues, also subvert this language binary and its exploitation by marketing forces. My analysis calls for a necessary refinement of current approaches to translingualism in order to account for forms of in-betweenness that have been overlooked in the shadow of the bilingual lens.
